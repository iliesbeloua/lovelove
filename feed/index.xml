<p class="has-vce-cat-0-color has-text-color">Secrets to living a happier life<br>Wouldn’t you want to learn how to be happier in life?</p>



<p>It’s a question that we all ask ourselves at some point in our life. But you cannot successfully answer it, let alone strive towards achieving happiness in life unless you realize this one basic thing:</p>



<p>Happiness is not a station you arrive at, but a manner of traveling.</p>



<p>Happiness is not a destination – it’s a journey.</p>



<p>Most of us tend to think of happiness as a result. But in reality, happiness is also a driver to achieve more.</p>



<p>Unlike pleasure, which is generally a short-lived feeling of joy that comes from indulging in certain activities or through the fulfillment of a certain goal, happiness is more long-lasting. It is a stable and more permanent state of mind that helps you maintain a positive outlook on life regardless of what your current circumstances might be.</p>



<p>But what is the secret to living a happier life?</p>



<p>If you ask those who are already living the life that they have always dreamed of, most of them are likely to say something along the lines of making ‘small changes’ in your lifestyle.</p>



<p>Is it true? Can small changes make a big difference in determining how happy you are in life?</p>



<p>There’s only one way to find out.</p>



<p>Try to incorporate as many of the following habits as you can into your lifestyle:</p>



<p>1. Make a Pledge to Be Happy</p>



<p>Whatever the mind says, the body follows. So, consciously tune your mind to being happy and you will actually feel happy all the time.</p>



<p>Write motivational messages or well wishes for your own self and post them at different places throughout the home or on your office desk where you can see them multiple times throughout the day. This can be a simple one-liner such as ‘today is a good day to be happy.’</p>



<p>Or you can also frame a picture of your best moment(s) in life and place it by your bedside. When you begin the day by being reminded of a happy day, you will look forward to turning the following day into a memorable one as well.</p>



<p>2. Let Go of the Past</p>



<p>If you often find yourself sulking over the past events in your life, you are obviously burning your own happiness for no apparent gain. Learn to let go of the past, and stop feeling remorseful. Remember- no one makes mistakes deliberately. In fact, we only call them mistakes in hindsight.</p>



<p>Remind yourself that you are an incredible person with the power to achieve anything and everything that you set your mind to.</p>



<p>Repeat this affirmation until it actually sinks in.</p>



<p>And to really let go of the past for good, try to face it once and for all. Pour your heart out and pen down all those anguished thoughts. Then burn the paper, bury it underground, or simply toss in the bin – but go to bed that night knowing that it’s all out of your system.</p>

<p>Tips to achieve excellence in life<br>Who doesn’t want to live a happier, more fulfilling life? Obviously, everyone wants to achieve excellence in life.</p>



<p>We try to pursue excellence throughout our lives, yet very few of us come close to achieving it.</p>



<p>Whether you are trying to strengthen the relationships with your loved ones, eat healthier, perform better at work, or simply improve the overall quality of your life in general, you are likely to find yourself stumbling time and again.</p>



<p>It sure is difficult to achieve excellence in life. But it certainly isn’t impossible.</p>



<p>1. Wake Up Early in the Morning</p>



<p>If you really want to be successful in life, then you must start your day earlier than usual. And by waking up early, we don’t mean getting up just in time to have a proper breakfast and dress properly without having to hop around while putting on your jeans.</p>



<p>You need to practice rising with the sun – quite literally!</p>



<p>Why?</p>



<p>Well, because there’s something sacred about the pre-dawn hours. There are utmost peace and tranquility in the environment, the world is asleep, and there are no distractions to take away your focus.</p>



<p>Use this time to nourish your mind, body, and soul.</p>



<p>Practice yoga, do some exercise or read some quality books to relax and unwind. Alternatively, you can also use the early morning hours to get through the toughest tasks of the day.</p>



<p>2. Drink Plenty of Water</p>



<p>When it comes to staying alert and energized, nothing works wonders like drinking sufficient water throughout the day.</p>



<p>Give the fact that 70% of the human body is comprised of H2O, it should not come as a surprise why drinking plenty of water refreshes you all over.</p>



<p>Instead of gulping down coffee the first thing in the morning, make it a habit to drink a glass of water on an empty stomach instead. Not only does it provide numerous health benefits, but it also rejuvenates you instantly, giving you the mental sharpness you need to kickstart your day.</p>



<p>3. Practice Mindfulness</p>



<p>Since prehistoric times, meditation has been hailed for its effectiveness in helping people achieve excellence in life. It rewires your brain, develops concentration, and is a great way to go about fighting daily stressors.</p>



<p>Meditating for as little as ten minutes every day can train your mind to focus on any given subject. This facilitates you in meeting the daily agenda and ultimately achieving your life goals at large.</p>



<p>It makes you more aware of yourself as well as your surroundings and helps you develop positive thoughts. Moreover, meditation is also known to enhance mood and correct the sleep-wake cycle.</p>



<p>According to research, meditation is known to increase employee productivity by 120%.</p>



<p>4. Write Everything Down</p>



<p>Whether it’s the to-do list or a list of ideas for your next project, get it down on paper.</p>



<p>We are living in the age of digitalization, where even the simplest of tasks such as opening a door is fully automated. But don’t be surprised when we tell you to jot things down using an actual pen and paper.</p>



<p>Paste the paper on your refrigerator door, by your office desk, or any other place where you will notice it at least a couple of times throughout the day. When you see the list of tasks that are still pending, you will be more conscious about utilizing your time in the best possible manner so as to get things done in time.</p>



<p>Similarly, you can add to your list of creative ideas so that you have everything in one place when it’s time to work on the project.</p>



<p>Based on various studies conducted by renowned universities like Harvard, Yale, and Stanford University, maintaining a gratitude journal creates greater enthusiasm, strengthens determination and even improves your immune system.</p>



<p>5. Get a Daily Dose of Inspiration</p>



<p>Never ever underestimate the power of positive reinforcement when it comes to being more successful in life. But you don’t necessarily have to rely on others to acknowledge your efforts and praise you for your work.</p>



<p>Be your own cheerleader.</p>



<p>Remind yourself of your true potential every day, and believe that you have already had the power to turn your dreams into a reality. You just need to learn how to channel it in the right direction.</p>



<p>Whether it looks silly doing so or not, look yourself in the mirror and say it out loud, ‘I can do it.’</p>



<p>Another great way to achieve excellence in life is by developing a positive mindset is to learn from the experience of people who have attained the same.</p>



<p>Read the biographies of successful CEOs and iconic leaders to gain inspiration from the legends</p>



<p>6. Actively Remove Distractions</p>



<p>Distractions deter you from making significant progress on the road to success. And it goes without saying that your smartphone is perhaps the biggest distraction out there.</p>



<p>Survey results show that an average employee spends more than two hours on social media at work every day. This accounts for a loss of 13% of their total productivity.</p>



<p>Make sure to keep your smartphone on silent mode when working so that the frequent notifications don’t distract you from the task at hand. What’s even better is to stay logged out of your social media accounts on your mobile phone so that you aren’t tempted to check your feed every few minutes.</p>



<p>7. Set Priorities</p>



<p>Priority #1 circled with red pencil<br>You can be moving all your life and still not get anywhere.</p>



<p>If you value petty tasks over the more important ones, chances are you will always be stuck in a rut.</p>



<p>Most people try to get small things done first so that they can give their undivided attention to the main task later on. If you follow a similar approach, it’s best to stop doing so now.</p>



<p>More often than not, the trivial chores end up taking longer than expected. Plus, they drain your energy, so you lose focus on the real deal.</p>



<p>Learn to prioritize, and don’t be hesitant to delegate when required.</p>



<p>EndNote<br>The bottom line is that if you want to accomplish your goals and achieve excellence in life, you must first set straight your daily schedule. Building healthy habits automatically enable you to attain a productive lifestyle and live the life you have always wanted</p>

<p>If you have decided to take control of your life and actively work towards becoming a better version of yourself, congratulations are in order.</p>



<p>You have surely made a good decision and we commend you for that.</p>



<p>Studying personal development can help you overcome your fears, push past boundaries, and gradually work your way towards the fulfillment of your dreams.</p>



<p>But coming from someone with years of experience in the field of self-development, believe us when we say that there are many disadvantages of studying personal development too.</p>



<p>No, we don’t mean to discourage you. And we definitely don’t want you to think that the ability to achieve excellence in life lies beyond your control. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>All we are saying is that there are certain drawbacks of studying personal development that only a few people are aware of. And usually, these are the people who eagerly started out on the path to self-development, only to come to a standstill as negative feelings like low self-esteem begin to take over.</p>



<p>If you want to make the most of studying personal development and get the results that you desire, it’s essential to know what you are signing up for.</p>



<p>Here, we explore the dark side of personal development programs that hardly anyone ever talks about.</p>



<h2>The Disadvantages of Studying Personal Development</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20200804030926im_/https://347077-1073788-1-raikfcquaxqncofqfm.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/self-development-study-1024x575.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-359"/><figcaption>personal development concept on blackboard</figcaption></figure>



<p>The biggest problem with studying personal development stems from the fact that the way it is taken up often subverts the very benefit that people want to get out of it.</p>



<p>It doesn’t matter whether you are planning to pursue self-improvement by reading self-help books, watching online tutorials, attending a workshop, or by hiring a coach – because most self-help programs take a manipulative approach to encourage users to take charge of their lives.</p>



<p>They somehow end up making you feel as if there is something ‘wrong’ about you.</p>



<p>Sure, you might have some bad habits, such as procrastinating, that you yourself know need to be rectified. But there’s a high chance that in the drive to be more productive and live a more fulfilling life, you will develop an obsession towards perfectionism.</p>



<p>You start comparing your success and failures to others and gradually set unrealistic expectations for your own self. When you are highly focused on improving yourself, it’s only natural to think that you aren’t good enough at the moment.</p>



<p>As a result, you might sink into low self-esteem. Your self-confidence takes a toll as a feeling of inadequacy takes over and you accept this self-formed notion that you fall into a group of individuals who need to be ‘fixed.’</p>



<p>And it is this very belief that you need to need to undergo an exemplary change to achieve more in life is what proves detrimental to your growth.</p>



<h2>Why Studying Personal Development Can Slow Down Your Growth</h2>



<p>Let’s take a more in-depth look at why and how studying personal development has the potential to backfire and lead to results that are exactly the opposite of what you set out to achieve in the first place.</p>



<h3>It Encourages You to Pursue Unrealistic Goals</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20200804030926im_/https://347077-1073788-1-raikfcquaxqncofqfm.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/encourgaes-to-pursue-unrealistic-goals-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-360"/></figure>



<p>It’s no secret that defining your goals in life is the prerequisite of attaining excellence. But what if you start setting absurd goals? Or worse, what if others start defining the goals for you?</p>



<p>Of course, a professional personal development coach will help you discover your main purpose in life and then help you effectively work towards attaining it. But with self-help gurus available a dime a dozen in the online world, it shouldn’t be too surprising why many people willing to improve themselves end up trying to please others instead.</p>



<h3>It Traps You into Things That Aren’t Working</h3>



<p>Identifying the hurdles on your road to success is a vital part of all personal development programs. But there’s a catch to this step.</p>



<p>While the purpose of recognizing the roadblocks is to come with the best measures for navigating your way around them, most people become so intent on the first part that they forget to take the next step.</p>



<p>Put simply, one of the main disadvantages of studying personal development is that you can get too preoccupied with the challenges in life. You constantly zero in on things that didn’t go according to plan. Consequently, you see your life as far less than perfect and become more prone to feeling unhappy and unsuccessful.</p>



<h2>How to Make Personal Development Work For You</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20200804030926im_/https://347077-1073788-1-raikfcquaxqncofqfm.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/how-to-make-it-work-for-you.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-361"/></figure>



<p>If you want to gain the fruitful results of studying personal development that others often rave about, it’s important to learn this one basic thing: the negative things in life will scream at you, demanding attention, but the positive things only whisper. You need to seek them out yourself and excellence will soon follow on its own.</p>



<p>Study personal development with an open mindset.</p>



<p>Rather than being discouraged and viewing yourself as an individual who’s full of faults, understand that no one, and I repeat,&nbsp;<em>no one&nbsp;</em>is perfect.</p>



<p>Perfectionism is simply an illusion that will destroy your peace of mind the more you run after it. Your journey is yours alone. So, instead of seeing other people’s success as milestones, use their achievements to gain inspiration and continue moving forward on the road to betterment.</p>



<p>Above all, keep in mind that much like achieving happiness, personal development is not about arriving at a station – it’s the journey itself that counts.</p>



<p>You won’t magically wake up one day as the best version of yourself. The little steps you take towards improvement are all that matter at the end.</p>



<h2>End Note</h2>



<p>If you look up the term ‘studying personal development’ on the internet, you will be presented with a long list of all the benefits it brings and why it is a crucial step for anyone who’s willing to live a happier and more successful life. Hopefully, this article will have given you a fair idea of the disadvantages of studying personal development and why it’s important to prepare yourself well mentally before pursuing the path of self-development.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>6 Tips Backed by Scientific Research for happy life<br />
Achieving real happiness is easy as 1, 2, 3 once you understand the true essence of this word. Discover the secrets of attaining happiness in this detailed guide covering the top tips for living a good life.</p>
<p>Are you aware of the ‘Happiness Myth’?</p>
<p>You might not know it directly. But the ironic part is that like millions of other people in the pursuit of happiness, you too probably believe it to be true. In fact, there’s a high chance that you are living the myth already.</p>
<p>But what exactly is the happiness myth? How can you ensure that you don’t fall victim to the false beliefs of attaining happiness? And how can you achieve real, long-lasting happiness anyway?</p>
<p>In the following article, we will help you find the answers to everything you need to know about achieving true happiness.</p>
<p>This comprehensive guide discusses scientifically-backed tips for living a good life and simultaneously provides valuable insights into what prevents people from living the life they dream about.</p>
<p>If you are ready to turn your life around for the better, take a deep breath – it’s time to get started!</p>
<p>Let’s begin by first understanding what being happier in life entails in the first place.</p>
<p>Debunking the Happiness Myth<br />
The widely held (and incorrect) notion about happiness is that it comes through the fulfillment of your goals.</p>
<p>We are usually taught from a very young age that if we work hard and become successful, happiness will automatically follow.</p>
<p>Modern philosopher, psychology professor, and commentator, Jennifer M. Hecht, explains the misconception about happiness in her best-selling book The Happiness Myth: Why What We Think Is Right Is Wrong.</p>
<p>Hecht reveals how the modern economy is designed to thrive on people’s attempts to be happy in life. It misrepresents happiness because happiness simply isn’t good for business.</p>
<p>If you are happy with what you have, why would you need more?</p>
<p>Shawn Achor, known as one of the leading experts on the power of positive psychology, further highlights this concept in his research-based book, The Happiness Advantage.</p>
<p>Survey results show that a majority of Americans find it harder to enjoy free time than to stay busy at work.</p>
<p>This is because they are blindly following the preconceived notion that once they are successful, they will be happy.</p>
<p>If you think that you will achieve happiness once when finally land your dream job, marry the love of your life, buy your own house and so on, stop right here! And think again.</p>
<p>Happiness never comes from achieving something or someone. It is a part of your essence. It is something that comes from within.</p>
<p>As Khalil Gibran artfully said:</p>
<p>“Happiness is a myth we seek,</p>
<p>If manifested surely irks;</p>
<p>Like river speeding to the plain,</p>
<p>On its arrival slows and murks.”</p>
<p>This illustrates that while you might enjoy a sense of wellbeing as you aspire and push forth towards achieving a goal, the fact is that the feeling eludes you when you finally do meet your target. You cool off and start longing for other distant goals.</p>
<p>And this cycle never ends. So, to be happy in the real sense, you need to break free from this cycle and adopt healthy habits that not just rectify this general attitude, but also help you live a happier, more fulfilling life.</p>
<p>Tips for Living a Good Life<br />
Being happy in life is not as challenging as you might initially perceive it to be.</p>
<p>The following are some simple and easy-to-follow tips for living a good life that will raise your happiness level and help you stay cheerful even when things don’t go according to plan.</p>
<p>1. Eat Well<br />
If you are thinking, ‘wait, what do my eating habits have to do anything with how I feel?’ you aren’t alone. Many people are completely unaware of the effect of food on mental health.</p>
<p>Good food and good mood go together hand in hand.</p>
<p>When you eat unhealthy food items, you might gain short-term pleasure, but at the back of your mind, you yourself are aware of the long-term damage it can cause.</p>
<p>On the other hand, adopting healthy eating habits improves your sense of wellbeing and encourages you to take better care of yourself.</p>
<p>Research shows that eating fresh fruits and vegetables serves as an instant mood booster because it has a therapeutic effect. Various naturally found compounds in fruits and veggies have antidepressant properties and are essential for better mental health.</p>
<p>Replace your store-bought snacks with homemade salads, smoothies, and other nutritious goodies and you will soon notice the benefits on your body as well as the soul.</p>
<p>You need to remember, you are what you eat. So, eat your way to happiness!</p>
<p>2. Disconnect From the Online World<br />
All it takes is the click of a button – and social media sites help you get in touch with distant friends and family members anywhere and at any time.</p>
<p>But ironically, while social media has brought distant people together, it has also increased the distances between people at the same time.</p>
<p>Social media sites keep scrolling through the feeds idly for hours. You check your phone once every few minutes for a new message or update. You are constantly distracted by the buzz of notifications. And of course, eagerly anticipate getting the maximum number of likes on the post you just shared.</p>
<p>When you are so fixated on such things, your life tends to become more complicated than your Facebook relationship status.</p>
<p>Various studies reveal how excessive use of social media and an increased feeling of stress and anxiety have a positive correlation.</p>
<p>Recall the last time you saw a picture of your friend cruising at the Bahamas and wished you were there rather than sulking at your office desk.</p>
<p>If you preoccupy yourself with what others are doing in their lives and sharing on social media, you lose focus on your own goals.</p>
<p>You end up comparing yourself with others and this ultimately leads to low self-esteem, depression, inattention, and hyperactivity.</p>
<p>Put simply, one of the top tips for living a good life full of happiness is to limit your use of social media.</p>
<p>Don’t worry about being out of touch. Your true friends would know how to contact you nonetheless.</p>
<p>On a side note, when you come across something on social media that makes you feel like your life is less than perfect; remind yourself that no one posts their failures online.</p>
<p>3. Log In to the Real World<br />
When you have successfully learned how to disconnect yourself from social media, consider logging in to the real world to utilize the free time in the best possible manner.</p>
<p>And the best way to do so is to go out for a walk whenever you get time.</p>
<p>Be it a cold winter morning or a warm sunny day, let nothing stop you from taking a stroll outdoors.</p>
<p>Incorporating brisk walk or jogging into your daily routine not only brings in multiple health benefits but also plays an important role in determining your happiness level.</p>
<p>Research has shown that traveling to work on foot can actually boost productivity as it aids concentration and keeps you energized for the rest of the day.</p>
<p>If your workplace is relatively too far to walk, consider cycling to the office instead. This helps you connect with nature as you stay more attentive to your surroundings. Plus, the smell of the air and the rush of wind that you feel when out under the open sky can alleviate stress and increase mindfulness.</p>
<p>4. Use the Power of Kawaii<br />
This step may sound weird to many people, but like all other tips for living a good life covered in this article, this one is also backed by scientific research.</p>
<p>Kawaii is a Japanese word that literally means cute.</p>
<p>According to Japanese researchers, looking at pictures of cute animals like kittens and puppies or surrounding yourself with similar cute items such as stuff toys has the potential to make you feel happier.</p>
<p>This makes sense if you take a deeper look at the Japanese culture. You will come across many images of characters like Hello Kitty that evoke cute and childlike vibes. This is because these things produce positive feelings that help you increase focus and boost productivity. When you perform better, you feel better and this, in turn, improves your overall wellbeing.</p>
<p>It might not be something that your boss would be willing to hear. But using the power of kawaii is surely worth a try.</p>
<p>Don’t fret about what others might think and consider bringing a cute teddy bear at work. If that’s too mainstream for you, you can at least place a few adorable items on your desk instead. This can include a desk calendar with cute images of babies or any other stationery item that doesn’t scream ‘professionalism.’</p>
<p>5. Get Proper Night Sleep<br />
Maintaining a proper sleep-wake schedule is highly important if you want to improve the quality of your life.</p>
<p>A lack of sleep not only makes you feel lethargic all day long but also reflects poorly on your mood. You are more susceptible to feeling sad and in most cases, angry for no apparent reason. Small things are more likely to irritate you.</p>
<p>When you are tired, minor problems seem like a huge hurdle and you might end up making a mountain out of a molehill. But that’s not all.</p>
<p>Scientists believe that getting a proper night’s sleep is essential because it helps you fight daily stressors and thus, stay in a cheery mood.</p>
<p>The Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep stage occurs just before you are about to wake up. During this time your brain is more active and processing things at an incredibly fast pace without you having the slightest hint.</p>
<p>When you force yourself to wake up before it is done sorting things out, you are inviting trouble for your own mental health.</p>
<p>Therefore, practice going to bed early so you can catch up with a decent 6 to 8 hours of sound sleep.</p>
<p>6. Embrace Life Wholeheartedly<br />
Last but not least, the secret to living a good life is to embrace it wholeheartedly.</p>
<p>Ups and downs are a part of life. If you wait for things to get better in order to feel happier, you might just keep waiting forever.</p>
<p>As Dalai Lama said, ‘happiness is not readymade, it comes from our own actions.’</p>
<p>No matter what your current circumstances might be, reinforce the belief that you can be happy nonetheless. After all, happiness is all about energy.</p>
<p>Stressing over things will only attract more negativity in your life.</p>
<p>Accept the things for what they are, but continue to strive forward.</p>
<p>And if things get too overwhelming, don’t be hesitant to take a step back and relax if needed. Go for an outing with your friends or family or escape to a peaceful place all alone. Research shows that taking breaks, be it a micro or macro level, increases performance by having a positive effect on the person’s thought process.</p>
<p>Avoid over-thinking and stop comparing yourself to others. Everyone is on their own unique journey and you cannot become happy by trying to achieve what they have.</p>
<p>The experience of deep-rooted contentment and positive wellbeing will only come when you start appreciating what you already have.</p>
<p>End Note<br />
Life is only as complicated as we make it be. These tips for living a good life provide easy to implement, road-tested measures that will help you feel happier and more successful.</p>
<p>To sum it up, living a happy and fulfilling life requires that you eat healthier, sleep well, and let go of unproductive habits. Avoid wasting time on social media and do something fruitful such as exercising or meditating. Self-care is the first step towards living a quality life. So, become your own best friend today!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>What is self-admiration? Is it the hidden key to success? And what does admiring your own self mean anyway? Find out the answers in this detailed guide discussing the ultimate secret to achieving more in life.</em></p>
<p>If you ask people what the secret is for living a successful life, you will come across a variety of answers such as identifying your goals, pursuing your passion, developing a plan of action, being consistent in your efforts, perseverance, and so on.</p>
<p>But if you ask <em>successful</em> people what enabled them to reach where they are and live the life they had always envisioned, you are likely to find most of them answering something along the lines of ‘believing in yourself’ and ‘being confident in your abilities.’</p>
<h2>Finding the Hidden Key to Success</h2>

<p>Take a hint from the success stories of famous personalities like Oprah Winfrey and J.K. Rowling. Despite being born into a low-income family, Winfrey is known by millions of people all over the world today as a ‘billionaire philanthropist.’ Rowling, at one point in her life, was living penny-to-penny, and now, she is one of the wealthiest people in the world.</p>
<p>What did they have in common that made them so wildly successful?</p>
<p>They didn’t give up on their dreams!</p>
<p>They believed that they could turn their lives around and have whatever their hearts desired. And that’s precisely what they did!</p>
<p>Self-confidence. That’s where they started.</p>
<p>And it all begins with developing a sense of self-admiration – i.e., believing that you have the power to change your life regardless of what your current circumstances might be forcing you to think otherwise.</p>
<p>Whether you are on the road to self-improvement, trying to find the hidden key to success, or wondering if a lack of confidence affects your quality of life, this post is for you.</p>
<p>In this guide to life freedom, we discuss the following aspects of self-admiration:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is self-admiration?</li>
<li>What are the benefits of self-admiration?</li>
<li>How to gain freedom in life through self-admiration?</li>
</ul>
<p>Ready to turn your dreams into a reality and live the life you have always wanted?</p>
<p>Let’s begin by taking a more in-depth look at what self-admiration is and shattering some commonly held but false beliefs about this feeling of self-love.</p>
<h2>What Is Self Admiration?</h2>
<p>Well, in the simplest terms, self-admiration is just what you would generally understand by the individual words that it is comprised of –admiring yourself.</p>
<p>Self-admiration is the feeling of being pleased with yourself. It is thinking well of yourself and taking pride in who you are.</p>
<p>However, the concept of self-admiration can be quite confusing at times. This is because the term ‘self-admiration’ tends to mislead people into viewing the idea under a negative light.</p>
<h3>Self Admiration – What It Is NOT</h3>
<p>Being fond of oneself is usually notorious for leading to disastrous results. This is because self-admiration is generally considered to be synonymous with conceitedness, self-centeredness, egocentrism, and arrogance.</p>
<p>While a thesaurus might approve of this notion, keep in mind that, in reality, self-admiration is NOT the same as any of these ideas.</p>
<p>Some scholars have written books about how self-admiration is a ‘disease of the soul’ as it is responsible for leading people into sin. They believe that self-admiration tricks you into a false sense of self-righteousness. It deludes you into thinking that you are perfect. So, you stop striving towards betterment and ultimately fall into a stagnant lifestyle.</p>
<p>It would be incorrect to say that they are entirely wrong in their stance – because if practiced at extremely high levels, self-admiration can indeed lead to such results.</p>
<p>However, self-admiration, in essence, is not a bad thing. Basically, there is a very thin line that distinguishes self-admiration from other harmful behaviors like self-obsession, self-absorption, self-centeredness, and selfishness itself.</p>

<p>Self-admiration is linked with building self-esteem. It is about celebrating your individuality, or in simple words, feeling <em>confident</em> in your own skin.</p>
<p>It is the belief that you are not just worthy of receiving good things in life, but more so, that you are perfectly capable of achieving them on your own – if you want.</p>
<p>Self-admiration is what empowers you to attain excellence. It motivates you to strive towards your goals in a way that you are bound to be successful in your endeavors.</p>
<p>Admiring yourself has nothing to do with good looks. Rather, it entails embracing yourself wholeheartedly – imperfections and all.</p>
<p>Self-admiration means that you appreciate your uniqueness and what makes you, you.</p>
<h2>Why Self-Admiration Is the Hidden Key to Success – The Benefits of Being Your Own Admirer</h2>
<p>Everyone feels proud of themselves whenever they are successful in attaining what they had set out to achieve. Self-admiration means that you take pride in the so-called ‘failures’ as well.</p>
<p>When you stop being too hard on yourself and realize that mistakes ultimately help you improve, you are able to push past your fear of failure and work towards your goals, feeling more confident in your skills. This further increases your chances of success.</p>
<p>There are many reasons why self-admiration is the hidden key to success:</p>
<ul>
<li>It makes you optimistic about the future</li>
<li>It helps you put in your best efforts as you realize that you have the ability to accomplish your goals</li>
<li>Self-admiration encourages you to treat yourself kindly</li>
<li>It motivates you to take better care of yourself. Nurturing self-love is important as it helps you eat healthier and stay in good shape by maintaining an active lifestyle</li>
<li>Admiring yourself and your achievements in life so far automatically uplift your mood and make you feel energized. This, in turn, increases your overall satisfaction in life</li>
<li>Self-admiration helps you break free from unproductive habits such as procrastinating by motivating you to get things done on time</li>
<li>It enables you to maintain a positive outlook on life even if things seem pretty bleak. This is crucial for living that’s full of joy always and not dictated by factors that were out of your control anyway</li>
<li>It makes you more grateful by instilling a sense of appreciation for everything in life – even the apparently bad ones</li>
<li>Self-admiration strengthens your relationships with others</li>
<li>It builds your interpersonal skills as others feel attracted to your amiable personality</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to Gain Freedom in Life – Self-Admiration Made Easy</h2>
<p>Still not sure how self-admiration can help you navigate your way on the road to success? Or did you get the idea but are confused about implementing it in the right manner to get the desired results?</p>
<p>Whatever the case might be, carefully read through the following steps to develop a deeper insight into how appreciating and believing in yourself can take you to greater heights.</p>
<h3>Be True to Yourself</h3>
<p>An important step in learning to be comfortable in your own skin is to stop pretending and doing things for the sake of making others happy.</p>
<p>More often than not, living a happier, more purposeful life is not that difficult, but we tend to complicate things for ourselves. Trying to please others might help you win the love of your life or appear ‘good’ in the eyes of others temporarily. However, the relationships you form on that basis are bound to be hollow, and so, will fail to withstand the test of time.</p>
<p>Being more successful is all about growing and evolving into the person you are capable of being. And you cannot reach there by trying to be like someone else.</p>
<p>As Oscar Wilde famously said, ‘Be yourself, because everyone else is already taken.’</p>
<p>Plus, an original is always worth more than a copy.</p>
<p>When you start appreciating your own worth, the world naturally follows suit.</p>
<h3>Let It Go</h3>

<p>One of the best ways to leverage the power of self-admiration for being more successful in life is to identify and deal with the root causes of low self-esteem.</p>
<p>Perhaps you have always been the target of criticism from your family members. Maybe your parents’ style of upbringing led you into believing that you aren’t ‘good enough.’ Or perhaps you used to be a confident person until you stepped into the corporate world and had to deal with a lot of complaints from your manager or your clients.</p>
<p>No matter what the main reason might be, you need to raise your self-esteem back up again.</p>
<p>Remind yourself that what others think of you is none of your business. No one can make you feel inferior without your consent. Harsh remarks and rude comments cannot cause you any harm until you give them the power to.</p>
<p>And if it’s about your job performance, or if it’s truly constructive criticism, take the feedback with an open mind. Try to see things from the other person’s perspective. This helps make critical work for you.</p>
<h3>Get Things Done</h3>
<p>Maybe you want to start your own business, buy a big house, or establish a school for the underprivileged children, and so on. If your own goal seems to be too far from reality, there’s no need to be disheartened. Rather than feeling overwhelmed by the big picture, focus on taking small steps instead.</p>
<p>While others can surely support you in your mission, it is important to realize that the power to accomplish that goal lies with you only.</p>
<p>Break down bigger tasks into smaller, actionable steps. When you are able to complete the initial steps successfully, you will feel more confident in your abilities. It then provides a strong point for growing your self-belief even further.</p>
<h2>Disclaimer: Self Admiration is Healthy, Narcissism Is Not</h2>
<p>When you hear the word ‘self-admiration,’ do you picture a person looking at themselves in a mirror admiringly?</p>
<p>If you answered yes, you are not alone. And you are also not right.</p>
<p>This type of self-love is tilted more towards what is commonly known as narcissism.</p>
<p>Becoming your own admirer doesn’t mean that you spend hours gazing at your reflection each day. Nor does it mean that looking at your own image should be a source of utmost delight.</p>
<p>Of course, acknowledging that you are no less than an awesome person is part of the idea, but that surely isn’t what self-admiration is all about.</p>
<p>Self-admiration focuses on utilizing your inner strengths rather than your physical goodness to unlock the door to new opportunities. Narcissism, on the other hand, means that you are more concerned with the way you look rather than how well you perform. In a way, it makes you more dependent on others because you become reliant on external validation to work harder.</p>
<p>However, self-admiration lets you internalize a sense of worthiness. So, whether or not you get the praise you deserve, you always feel good about yourself anyway.</p>
<p>Put simply, self-admiration is healthy; narcissism is not. Period!</p>
<h2>End Note</h2>
<p>In the words of Prem Pal Rawat, ‘When there can be that admiration for the self, the rest is very, very simple.’</p>
<p>Rawat is an Indian American who earned the Global Peace Ambassador award for his works promoting human welfare through self-knowledge and self-improvement.</p>
<p>This alone is a solid proof that self-admiration is indeed the hidden key to success.</p>
<p>Self-admiration helps you realize your inner talents, making you feel more confident in pursuing your goals in a way that yields the desired results.</p>
<p>Just keep in mind that self-obsession and self-admiration are not the different sides of the same coin – the two are completely poles apart. The former will deter you from the road to success by making you arrogant and conceited, whereas the latter will allow you to effectively work towards bringing a change for good. So, start being your own cheerleader and witness how it empowers you to bring your A-game!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is not unusual for middle-borns to feel left out in the sibling shuffle. But is the middle child syndrome a real thing? Are all middle children resentful and bitter? Does being a middle child affect your personality? Should you be concerned about this condition? (Or for your kids developing the same?)</p>
<p>Whether you are a parent looking for tips to raise your younger ones well, or a middle child who’s curious to learn more about a ‘syndrome’ named especially after them, you have come to the right place.</p>
<p>In this guide on dealing with the middle child syndrome, we will help you find all the answers you need by uncovering the truth behind this ‘psychological condition.’</p>
<p>Let’s begin by first understanding what the syndrome entails in the first place.</p>
<h2>What Is Middle Child Syndrome?</h2>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img class="wp-image-339" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20200804024811im_/https://347077-1073788-1-raikfcquaxqncofqfm.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/is-it-really-a-sundrome-1024x682.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="//web.archive.org/web/20200804024811im_/https://347077-1073788-1-raikfcquaxqncofqfm.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/is-it-really-a-sundrome-1024x682.jpg 1024w, //web.archive.org/web/20200804024811im_/https://347077-1073788-1-raikfcquaxqncofqfm.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/is-it-really-a-sundrome-300x200.jpg 300w, //web.archive.org/web/20200804024811im_/https://347077-1073788-1-raikfcquaxqncofqfm.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/is-it-really-a-sundrome-768x512.jpg 768w, //web.archive.org/web/20200804024811im_/https://347077-1073788-1-raikfcquaxqncofqfm.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/is-it-really-a-sundrome-1080x720.jpg 1080w, //web.archive.org/web/20200804024811im_/https://347077-1073788-1-raikfcquaxqncofqfm.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/is-it-really-a-sundrome.jpg 1280w" alt="" /></figure>
<p>The middle child syndrome refers to the feeling of exclusion that is commonly experienced by most children who aren’t the eldest or the youngest in their group of siblings.  It is the belief that middle children often feel ignored, or at times, even completely neglected because of their birth order.</p>
<p>As the general belief goes, middle children tend to be resentful and bitter. They mostly have a negative outlook on life as they are plagued by feelings of unworthiness which ultimately characterizes into low self-esteem, and makes them isolate themselves from the outside world.</p>
<p>In extreme cases, middle child syndrome can also reflect on psychotic behavior in later years.</p>
<p>This condition was first explored by an Austrian psychiatrist, Alfred Adler, in 1964.</p>
<p>Adler, who worked closely with the renowned neurologist and the founder of psychoanalysis, Sigmund Freud, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200804024811/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3375868/">developed a theory</a> relating a person’s birth order with their personality development.</p>
<p>The theory suggested that a person’s rank among their siblings has a major influence on their mental wellbeing. It affects their ability to cope with stress and anxiety, as well as their problem-solving skills and psychological development later in life.</p>
<p>Many people agree that middle children are more susceptible to negative feelings than their siblings raised in the same environment. But the extent and severity of the middle child syndrome, as well as the likelihood of middle-born suffering from this condition, have long been debated over.</p>
<p>This brings us to the next question:</p>
<h2>Is the Middle Child Syndrome a Real Thing?</h2>
<p>Katrin Schumann, a certified psychologist, and researcher explore the concept in her book, <em>The Secret Power of the Middle Children</em>.</p>
<p>According to Schumann, middle child syndrome is not really a syndrome. Rather, it’s an ‘observation’ – i.e., the middle child syndrome is not something that you can catch or develop with the passage of time. It is more of a temporary behavior that dissipates on its own as the children grow older.</p>
<p>In other words, the symptoms of middle child syndrome do not necessarily depend on the birth order entirely. They have more to do with the family background and the manner in which the children are raised in the first place.</p>
<h2>Dealing with the Middle Child Syndrome</h2>
<p>You might have come across your fair share of relatives or acquaintances who believe that middle children tend to fare worse in life. Or perhaps what you read above resonated with you and you really do feel neglected, hurt, and, at times, even completely left out by your own family. You might be tired of being overshadowed by your siblings at various instances in life and feel like you never got the love and attention that you deserved from your parents.</p>
<p>If that’s the case, it’s important to remind yourself that as humans, we all make mistakes. Even if you feel like your parents hugely favor one child over the other, it is unlikely that they are doing it on purpose.</p>
<p>If it’s really too severe and you are having difficulty in dealing with the differences in behavior, it’s best to have a proper discussion. Rather than suffering in silence, let your family know about your concerns so that they can help solve it together.</p>
<p>Similarly, if you have a middle child of your own, reach out to them first. Have a friendly discussion to get to know if they feel left out. If you don’t want to be so straightforward, then it’s best that you take time out to make them feel special at least once in a while. Go out on a short trip, bake together, or do any other activity that brings you closer together. But remember not to overdo it because that can backfire and lead to exactly the opposite of what you’re trying to achieve.</p>
<h2>Concluding Note</h2>
<p>When it comes to dealing with middle child syndrome, the important thing to remember is that it is not a medical condition. Although it is common for middle children to feel neglected more than others in the family, the resulting ‘resentful’ behavior is not exclusive to middle-borns only. The eldest and youngest children in the family can also show rebellious behavior depending on their upbringing and the overall role that they play in the family.</p>
<p>Your personality might be slightly affected by your birth order. But it sure <em>isn’t</em> determined by it solely. So, regardless of what the world might say (or even how you might feel being dominated by your siblings at times), know that you are the master of your own fate. You can craft your personality exactly the way you want.</p>
<p>If you never get the spotlight to yourself, there’s no need to worry. Be your own light, and others shall seek you on their own!</p>
