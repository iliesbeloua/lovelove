I was too busy following trends and wasting what wasn\u2019t my money on things I most definitely did not need.<\/p>\n<p>At this point, I was sure I had the Shiny Object Syndrome.<\/p>\n<p>It got so bad, I was spending thousands of dollars of my partners, and people\u2019s funds that I had leveraged for growth, on high-end coaching programs and courses with no return, all just to try and keep up with what the consumers were consuming right now.<\/p>\n<p><em>A lousy mindset, to say the least.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>I just wanted to make quick money, I was sold by numbers, screenshots, videos of marketers living the life, marketers flying to people\u2019s houses and getting them paid on the spot.<\/p>\n<p>Ha, the b.s. You come across on the search for success.<\/p>\n<p>We could talk all day about the loop people are stuck in on the hunt for success, but there\u2019s so much shit you get wrapped up in that I could never stop writing about the trials you will face.<\/p>\n<p>I want to save you from this madness because I promise you it\u2019s dangerous, you\u2019ll end up going crazy!<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s how I\u2019m going to do that:<\/p>\n<h3>By not selling you a single thing.<\/h3>\n<p>I don\u2019t want your money, and here\u2019s the big reason why\u2026<\/p>\n<p>Because my business does NOT run off my customers\/clients, instead, I have personally designed online systems and companies that supply me my income and let me spend more of my time positively impacting my chosen market (that\u2019s one difference I spotted between the genuine and fake marketers).<\/p>\n<p>To get there, it\u2019s simple.<\/p>\n<p>Find something you enjoy, something you can find a genuine mentor in, something that works, something that will sustain for years to come, remove yourself from negative communities, surround yourself with people that support your vision and search for people that will supply you your dreams.<\/p>\n<p>Why am I telling you all of this?<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve explained the shit hole I once was in, but I didn\u2019t tell you what happened further, how I changed my entire life around, and hit the majority of my long-term goals within the same year of them being set.<\/p>\n<p>Over the past 5 years, I\u2019ve lost more close friends, family, and money than I could ever imagine I\u2019d lose.<\/p>\n<p>Not talking deaths, but relationships that I had to severe for the betterment of my future.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m not only talking seriously wrong investments, like the $18k hole I got myself in but spending countless thousands on mentoring to obtain the information I felt I needed to get closer to my dreams.<\/p>\n<p>Early 2015, I had had enough and decided I\u2019ve gotta start fresh\u2026 or throw in the towel.<\/p>\n<p>That same year, an excellent opportunity came my way (any chance was needed at this time due to the struggle I was facing and the holes I found myself in).<\/p>\n<h3><strong>My first freelance client. August 2015.<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>This led to my first financial breakthrough in December 2015.<\/p>\n<p>My mentors along the way, including my first freelance client whom all spoke to me the same words I speak to you today.<\/p>\n<p>They all taught me to stay focused and be consistent in whatever I do. These 2 things alone bought me freedom, gave me the life I always desired for myself and the future family I am creating.<\/p>\n<p>Over a quarter of a million dollars was generated through my business in the last 4 months of 2015 and the client I took on went into launch early the following year, they generated over $10,000,000 revenue throughout their first year of being in business.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, slow and steady wins the race<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I have promoted several MLM\u2019s, I have used free traffic to make money, I have used solo ads, I have also sold solo ads, I have tried SEO, I have done webinars, I have spent thousands trying to sell t-shirts, I have attempted e-commerce out on a whole, I have dabbled with PPV marketing with [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":331,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":true,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"spay_email":""},"categories":[6],"tags":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/dailytweet.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/pexels-te-lensfix-1371360-1.jpg","jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/pcxU2T-5j","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/dailytweet.me\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/329"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/dailytweet.me\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/dailytweet.me\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/dailytweet.me\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/dailytweet.me\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=329"}],"version-history":[{"count":2,"href":"https:\/\/dailytweet.me\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/329\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":581,"href":"https:\/\/dailytweet.me\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/329\/revisions\/581"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/dailytweet.me\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/331"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/dailytweet.me\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=329"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/dailytweet.me\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=329"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/dailytweet.me\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=329"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
