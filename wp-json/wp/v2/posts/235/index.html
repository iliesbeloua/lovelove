What we portray ourselves to be is what gets imprinted in the minds of the people we meet for the first time. It&#8217;s the first few minutes of the conversation they will use to judge you. And the impression you create may last forever. These tips will help you make that impression to be great.<\/p>\n<p>1. Make the first move Don&#8217;t wait for people to come to you. Go to them and initiate a conversation. We know how people who are good making friends out of strangers are aggressive. They will approach you and start it like they have known you their whole life. Move up to people and say a &#8216; hi&#8217; to them. The rest will come automatically.<\/p>\n<p>2. Smile A smile is infectious. Smile at a person, and they will smile right back and think you like them, that you want and are happy to be around them. They will, in turn, want to be friends with you. Who doesn&#8217;t like to be around people who like them? There is no nicer way to strike friendship.<\/p>\n<p>3. Maintain eye contact Looking straight into the eyes of someone you are talking to shows you are interested in what they are saying. Avoid looking away or looking at your phone. They may think that they are boring and that you want the conversation to end. Eye contact also makes you appear bold and confident. You will appear honest; dishonest people often avoid eye contact.<\/p>\n<p>4. Listen Always listen when the other person is talking. Avoid unnecessary interruptions, or you may appear rough and belittling. People like it when others allow them the chance to talk.<\/p>\n<p>5 . Radiate warmth Don&#8217;t be dull or the conversation will die away. You will appear bored or uninterested. When talking do it with enthusiasm and look like you are fully immersed in it. Chances ate the other person will copy you, and you will have a great conversation.<\/p>\n<p>6. Complement as a starter A complement is a great conversation starter. Tell them how good they look. Or you. A complement a possession, like how their car looks nice. It works magic, and the other person will open up to conversation.<\/p>\n<p>7. Use proper body language A lazy posture portrays you as uninterested and fidgeting as nervous. Maintaining an upright posture makes you appear confident, and wins you, friends. Using powerful gestures while talking keeps the other person glued to the conversation, and with interest too. Don&#8217;t smile too much or you will appear to lack seriousness. Make it moderate, the kind that shows you are friendly. Avoid pointing at the person you are speaking to; it makes them think you are overly aggressive and domineering.<\/p>\n<p>8. Have a sense of humor No one wants to hang around a boring person. A laugh makes for a great conversation. Crack a joke or two and laugh together. The person will never forget you. People like to be around people who are funny. It makes life less serious and interesting. To be a great cracker of jokes, make people who are talented in humor your friends. You will learn the art from them with time. Or you can watch comedy and learn some punch lines.<\/p>\n<p>9. Create a personality to fit We all behave differently when talking to different people. Like for example, the way you would talk to a musician is not the same way you would talk to a company executive. And for a reason, because we view life differently depending on our professions. So create a personality that blends with theirs. This way you will avoid offending them, or appearing irrelevant and uninteresting. You can start off your conversation by knowing what they do so you can adjust your conversation accordingly. Using these tips will help you win friend and create a lasting impression on the people you meet in your daily life.<\/p>\n<p>10. Find out what you have in common Start by talking about something that interests you. Or you can ask them what they do, or what their hobbies are. Once you get talking about something you both love, there will be no stopping to the conversation. And you will form a strong friendship based on shared likes. You can even tell them where you live or work. If you share a neighborhood or company, you will instantly become friends with a lot to talk about.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>First impressions are important.
