Obviously, everyone wants to achieve excellence in life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We try to pursue excellence throughout our lives, yet very few of us come close to achieving it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you are trying to strengthen the relationships with your loved ones, eat healthier, perform better at work, or simply improve the overall quality of your life in general, you are likely to find yourself stumbling time and again.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It sure is difficult to achieve excellence in life. But it certainly isn\u2019t impossible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. Wake Up Early in the Morning<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you really want to be successful in life, then you must start your day earlier than usual. And by waking up early, we don\u2019t mean getting up just in time to have a proper breakfast and dress properly without having to hop around while putting on your jeans.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You need to practice rising with the sun \u2013 quite literally!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, because there\u2019s something sacred about the pre-dawn hours. There are utmost peace and tranquility in the environment, the world is asleep, and there are no distractions to take away your focus.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Use this time to nourish your mind, body, and soul.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Practice yoga, do some exercise or read some quality books to relax and unwind. Alternatively, you can also use the early morning hours to get through the toughest tasks of the day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. Drink Plenty of Water<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to staying alert and energized, nothing works wonders like drinking sufficient water throughout the day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Give the fact that 70% of the human body is comprised of H2O, it should not come as a surprise why drinking plenty of water refreshes you all over.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of gulping down coffee the first thing in the morning, make it a habit to drink a glass of water on an empty stomach instead. Not only does it provide numerous health benefits, but it also rejuvenates you instantly, giving you the mental sharpness you need to kickstart your day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. Practice Mindfulness<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since prehistoric times, meditation has been hailed for its effectiveness in helping people achieve excellence in life. It rewires your brain, develops concentration, and is a great way to go about fighting daily stressors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meditating for as little as ten minutes every day can train your mind to focus on any given subject. This facilitates you in meeting the daily agenda and ultimately achieving your life goals at large.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It makes you more aware of yourself as well as your surroundings and helps you develop positive thoughts. Moreover, meditation is also known to enhance mood and correct the sleep-wake cycle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to research, meditation is known to increase employee productivity by 120%.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4. Write Everything Down<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether it\u2019s the to-do list or a list of ideas for your next project, get it down on paper.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are living in the age of digitalization, where even the simplest of tasks such as opening a door is fully automated. But don\u2019t be surprised when we tell you to jot things down using an actual pen and paper.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Paste the paper on your refrigerator door, by your office desk, or any other place where you will notice it at least a couple of times throughout the day. When you see the list of tasks that are still pending, you will be more conscious about utilizing your time in the best possible manner so as to get things done in time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, you can add to your list of creative ideas so that you have everything in one place when it\u2019s time to work on the project.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on various studies conducted by renowned universities like Harvard, Yale, and Stanford University, maintaining a gratitude journal creates greater enthusiasm, strengthens determination and even improves your immune system.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>5. Get a Daily Dose of Inspiration<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Never ever underestimate the power of positive reinforcement when it comes to being more successful in life. But you don\u2019t necessarily have to rely on others to acknowledge your efforts and praise you for your work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Be your own cheerleader.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remind yourself of your true potential every day, and believe that you have already had the power to turn your dreams into a reality. You just need to learn how to channel it in the right direction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether it looks silly doing so or not, look yourself in the mirror and say it out loud, \u2018I can do it.\u2019<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another great way to achieve excellence in life is by developing a positive mindset is to learn from the experience of people who have attained the same.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read the biographies of successful CEOs and iconic leaders to gain inspiration from the legends<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>6. Actively Remove Distractions<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Distractions deter you from making significant progress on the road to success. And it goes without saying that your smartphone is perhaps the biggest distraction out there.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Survey results show that an average employee spends more than two hours on social media at work every day. This accounts for a loss of 13% of their total productivity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make sure to keep your smartphone on silent mode when working so that the frequent notifications don\u2019t distract you from the task at hand. What\u2019s even better is to stay logged out of your social media accounts on your mobile phone so that you aren\u2019t tempted to check your feed every few minutes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>7. Set Priorities<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Priority #1 circled with red pencil<br>You can be moving all your life and still not get anywhere.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you value petty tasks over the more important ones, chances are you will always be stuck in a rut.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most people try to get small things done first so that they can give their undivided attention to the main task later on. If you follow a similar approach, it\u2019s best to stop doing so now.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>More often than not, the trivial chores end up taking longer than expected. Plus, they drain your energy, so you lose focus on the real deal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Learn to prioritize, and don\u2019t be hesitant to delegate when required.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>EndNote<br>The bottom line is that if you want to accomplish your goals and achieve excellence in life, you must first set straight your daily schedule. Building healthy habits automatically enable you to attain a productive lifestyle and live the life you have always wanted<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Tips to achieve excellence in lifeWho doesn\u2019t want to live a happier, more fulfilling life?
