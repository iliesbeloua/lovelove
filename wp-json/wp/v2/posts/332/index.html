It\u2019s actually not that hard.<\/p>\n<p>I grew my breakfast appetite with one simple trick, and that was having boiling water with freshly squeezed lemon every single morning.<\/p>\n<p>Gradually, my stomach started to open up and my craving for food at breakfast time skyrocketed.<\/p>\n<p>Many times in the week now, I eat more at breakfast time than I do at dinner.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, there is no strict time for breakfast but before 10 AM really hits the spot and beyond this you know you have started your day on the wrong foot.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Sleep Earlier<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Sleeping earlier does not mean sleeping early. It simply means making a change to your current lifestyle.<\/p>\n<p>If you currently sleep at midnight, for example, bring it an hour back to eleven and execute this sleeping pattern in your life for the next month.<\/p>\n<p>This will cause you to wake up earlier, feel fresher and more energized from the start of the day.<\/p>\n<p>Can you believe that all it takes is one hour of extra sleep in the night and your life will significantly change for the better?<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s not the sleep that creates impact, it\u2019s the change. Small changes lead to even better outcomes.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Design Your Life<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Live a life of design, not accident.<\/p>\n<p>You don\u2019t want to wake up in the morning thinking \u201cdamn, I did it again.\u201d Instead, you want to feel satisfied with yourself every morning and be able to enter your day with full enthusiasm.<\/p>\n<p>The time you wake up and the time you sleep, the times you eat, the times you play, and the times you work.<\/p>\n<p>All these times are for you to plan and live by.<\/p>\n<p>I will end this point with one straightforward formula of life, the six P\u2019s.<\/p>\n<p>Prior Planning Prevents Piss-Poor Performance.<\/p>\n<p>You plan, you live, and you succeed. Every time a plan is fulfilled, the sense of accomplishment is attained.<\/p>\n<p>For every plan you don\u2019t make, another accident is formed, and a life of error is created.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Perform Daily<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Act on your goals every day.<\/p>\n<p>As part of your goals should be your desire for change. For every want you have comes its own set of challenges.<\/p>\n<p>These challenges go against your way of living, your integrity, your pride and a lot more internal factors.<\/p>\n<p>It is yourself you must control, take power over and instil change in to experience the greatness of life.<\/p>\n<p>I guess what I mean to say is, whether up or down, sad or ecstatic, you must take some form of action geared for positive change each and every single day.<\/p>\n<p>A day missed is a day wasted, and an effort given is change in fruition.<\/p>\n<p>I have one quote I want you to remember, maybe even take note of somewhere because this will affect your performance tremendously.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\">\n<blockquote class=\"has-text-color has-very-dark-gray-color\"><p>\u201cImperfect action beats perfect inaction every time.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<\/figure>\n<p>The art of doing nothing only produces negativity, whereas doing something brings you closer to positive change and provides empowerment.<\/p>\n<p>Take full control over your life. This does not stop at your sleep, your diet or your work life but extends over to your thoughts, the information you consume and the relationships you keep.<\/p>\n<p>Living a life of design will provide you with what you need and more.<\/p>\n<p>A life of accident will take from you all the good you have and leave you with dust<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It doesn\u2019t always come easy, and it most certainly didn\u2019t for me.
