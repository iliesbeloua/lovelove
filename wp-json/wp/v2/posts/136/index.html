You can do it from the comfort of your home. Here are some examples of things you can do. You probably don&#8217;t want to do everything in a single workout, however, make sure you rotate so that your whole body is getting worked at some point. Today, we will discuss our top 10 favorites with no equipment exercises which you should include in your own home workouts.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This old military favorite is a tried and true winner and muscle builder. It&#8217;s easy to perform and just about everyone knows how to do it. I won&#8217;t go into detail explaining how to do a push-up but, I will give you some important tips. Begin by doing as many push-ups as you can do &#8212; until you can&#8217;t do anymore. Then rest for one to two minutes. Then begin again doing push-ups until you can&#8217;t do anymore. Rest again for one to two minutes and continue doing this sequence for a total of three times or three sets.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"has-vivid-cyan-blue-color has-text-color\">2. Pull-Ups Or Chin-Ups<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"has-vivid-cyan-blue-color has-text-color\">\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Again another standby exercise that most people know how to do. The point here is to not stress your neck. Anchor your legs to a chair or table so that they will not lift up as you do the movement. Bend your knees to a &#8212; 90 angle (this will not be a full situp, but a partial crunch.) By now you should know the routine perform as many as you can &#8212; for a total of three sets &#8212; resting no more than one to two minutes between sets.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"has-vivid-cyan-blue-color has-text-color\">4. Abs crunches<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"has-vivid-cyan-blue-color has-text-color\">\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Press up is an excellent exercise for your upper body and back muscles and that too without the help of any equipment. Start by keeping your knees and hips in a line and keep your hands apart wider than your shoulder width. Make this exercise hard by placing your feet on a bench and make it easier by putting your hands on a higher place.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"has-vivid-cyan-blue-color has-text-color\">6. Step-up<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This exercise can be easily performed at your home or at a park. You just need a bench for this. Place your heel on the bench and then step up. Step down with less slowly. Make this exercise harder by stepping on to a higher object or pushing less hard from the ground. If you find this exercise hard the step onto a lower bench or push harder from the ground.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"has-vivid-cyan-blue-color has-text-color\">7. Salt bridge<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This is a good exercise for muscles on the sides of your torso. Li on your one side with your elbows and feet in a straight line. Now elevate your hips. This position strengthens your torso muscles. Make it easier by using a bench to raise your hand or elbow.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"has-vivid-cyan-blue-color has-text-color\">8. Bodyweight squats<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>No weight, nothing. Just you squatting with your own body weight. Many people think that because this is a simple exercise that it&#8217;s automatically easy. Not so. This really tests you. What you ideally want to do is 25 squats in a row. Then take a short rest and repeat. Doing this for 4 sets every day not only will tone and tighten your legs, but also help you to shed fat from all over your body.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>It is only in shadow boxing that one can imagine the opponent having attacking and defending moves played out through the rounds. Where counteractions can be practiced without an actual opponent striking or even the threat of being hut-like when in sparring, (sparring meaning: in the ring against an opponent in the boxing gym ring, usually a club mate).<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>There is a hesitancy following through all actions effectively to the point of mastery, if under threat of being punched in the face every time if throwing incorrectly.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This undermines the potential at hand by not completing actual punch moves or stance positioning correctly. When shadow boxing there is no threat existing, having no opponent. Which then removes the &#8216; being hut factor &#8216; drawback so important ring movement abilities and punching effectiveness are able to have mastery at any level.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"has-vivid-cyan-blue-color has-text-color\">\u00a0<\/p>\r\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In today&#8217;s world, you don&#8217;t need to go to a gym to get a full workout.
