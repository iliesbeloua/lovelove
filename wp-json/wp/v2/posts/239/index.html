If you don\u2019t, then take it from us: it\u2019s important! Aside from having a huge effect on our bodies and our physical health, food can also have a big impact on our mental health as well.

It can help everyone push themselves and make their training much more efficient and productive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the main ingredients in spirulina is tryptophan, which synthesizes other proteins and balances out your nervous system.
