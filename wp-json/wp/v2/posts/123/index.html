It can improve the physical, emotional and mental well-being of both parties in the relationship. This being said, not all relationships tend to realize these benefits; it only works for stable well-cultivated relationships.<\/p>\n<p>Physical benefits of love<br \/>\nBeing in love bring a sparkle in your eyes and make your eyes look brighter. Research proves that people who are in love tend to experience more frequent adrenaline rushes due to physical and emotional arousal. Adrenaline and sex hormones are responsible for feelings of love. They make your eyes dilate giving you a dramatic doe-eyed look which most people find attractive.<\/p>\n<p>A healthy love relationship with great sex can improve lip health. The rushes that people get when they are in love or when they feel in love improve blood flow in the lips giving them a plumper, healthier look. It makes your pout look a bit plumper which looks good.<\/p>\n<p>Having regular sex improves the amount of blood that flows through the breasts in women giving them a firm look. It also increases the levels of oxytocin which help to keep breasts cancer free.<\/p>\n<p>Research shows that engaging in regular sex increase hair growth. Sex leads to increase in the production of hormones like testosterone which help to decrease hair loss and boost hair growth. It also makes your hair shine. Hair loss can also be as a result of stress. Stress activates neurotransmitters that interfere with hair growth. It also causes blood capillaries to constrict which results in poor blood flow to the scalp hence reducing hair growth. A happy relationship offers a platform for sharing which helps to reduce stress hence curbing hair loss.<\/p>\n<p>A stable relationship is the beginning of a long, healthy life. Studies carried out since the late 70s show that people in happy long-term relationships are generally healthier than those who aren\u2019t. They tend to have a lower risk of suffering from stress-related diseases like ulcer and high blood pressure. They also have lower cancer rates too.<\/p>\n<p>Mental and emotional benefits of love<br \/>\nBeing in a relationship determines your levels of energy, both physical and emotional. While being in sad relationship drains your mental energy, being in a happy relationship helps build positive energy. A stable relationship that offers happiness offers makes you feel cherished and loved hence making you feel good about yourself.<\/p>\n<p>A relationship works in a give-and-take mechanism. It puts you in a position to where you can give and receive at the same time. Research shows that giving lights up the midbrain region of your brain which is responsible for pleasure. Giving derives a similar pleasure to that of sex which makes you happier.<\/p>\n<p>A healthy relationship promotes internal growth. It allows you to learn and grow with a person either directly or indirectly. A loving partner will always make sure that you are the best version of yourself. They will urge you to explore different versions of you and find your best self. A more mature partner can help mentor and direct the other partner as they grow in love. A relationship offers a mirror to you: it allows you to look at yourself in the mirror of another person. Broken relationships also offer lessons on places one might have gone wrong and need to improve. A relationship allows two people to grow individually as well as grow one another.<\/p>\n<p>There are many things that could stress someone: work, family, responsibilities, failures, and friends. Being in a relationship allows some to share their mental burden. The other party may or may not be able to help, but a keen ear from a loving partner makes you feel good. Being sure that you have someone to talk to and work things out together helps you handle stress in a better way. Having less stress promotes good mental and physical health.<\/p>\n<p>In conclusion, there are a number of benefits that come from a stable relationship.
