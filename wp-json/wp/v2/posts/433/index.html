And we definitely don\u2019t want you to think that the ability to achieve excellence in life lies beyond your control. &nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All we are saying is that there are certain drawbacks of studying personal development that only a few people are aware of. And usually, these are the people who eagerly started out on the path to self-development, only to come to a standstill as negative feelings like low self-esteem begin to take over.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to make the most of studying personal development and get the results that you desire, it\u2019s essential to know what you are signing up for.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here, we explore the dark side of personal development programs that hardly anyone ever talks about.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Disadvantages of Studying Personal Development<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20200804030926im_\/https:\/\/347077-1073788-1-raikfcquaxqncofqfm.stackpathdns.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/self-development-study-1024x575.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-359\"\/><figcaption>personal development concept on blackboard<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The biggest problem with studying personal development stems from the fact that the way it is taken up often subverts the very benefit that people want to get out of it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It doesn\u2019t matter whether you are planning to pursue self-improvement by reading self-help books, watching online tutorials, attending a workshop, or by hiring a coach \u2013 because most self-help programs take a manipulative approach to encourage users to take charge of their lives.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They somehow end up making you feel as if there is something \u2018wrong\u2019 about you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure, you might have some bad habits, such as procrastinating, that you yourself know need to be rectified. But there\u2019s a high chance that in the drive to be more productive and live a more fulfilling life, you will develop an obsession towards perfectionism.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You start comparing your success and failures to others and gradually set unrealistic expectations for your own self. When you are highly focused on improving yourself, it\u2019s only natural to think that you aren\u2019t good enough at the moment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a result, you might sink into low self-esteem. Your self-confidence takes a toll as a feeling of inadequacy takes over and you accept this self-formed notion that you fall into a group of individuals who need to be \u2018fixed.\u2019<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it is this very belief that you need to need to undergo an exemplary change to achieve more in life is what proves detrimental to your growth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Why Studying Personal Development Can Slow Down Your Growth<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s take a more in-depth look at why and how studying personal development has the potential to backfire and lead to results that are exactly the opposite of what you set out to achieve in the first place.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>It Encourages You to Pursue Unrealistic Goals<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20200804030926im_\/https:\/\/347077-1073788-1-raikfcquaxqncofqfm.stackpathdns.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/encourgaes-to-pursue-unrealistic-goals-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-360\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s no secret that defining your goals in life is the prerequisite of attaining excellence. But what if you start setting absurd goals? Or worse, what if others start defining the goals for you?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, a professional personal development coach will help you discover your main purpose in life and then help you effectively work towards attaining it. But with self-help gurus available a dime a dozen in the online world, it shouldn\u2019t be too surprising why many people willing to improve themselves end up trying to please others instead.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>It Traps You into Things That Aren\u2019t Working<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Identifying the hurdles on your road to success is a vital part of all personal development programs. But there\u2019s a catch to this step.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the purpose of recognizing the roadblocks is to come with the best measures for navigating your way around them, most people become so intent on the first part that they forget to take the next step.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Put simply, one of the main disadvantages of studying personal development is that you can get too preoccupied with the challenges in life. You constantly zero in on things that didn\u2019t go according to plan. Consequently, you see your life as far less than perfect and become more prone to feeling unhappy and unsuccessful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to Make Personal Development Work For You<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20200804030926im_\/https:\/\/347077-1073788-1-raikfcquaxqncofqfm.stackpathdns.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/how-to-make-it-work-for-you.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-361\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to gain the fruitful results of studying personal development that others often rave about, it\u2019s important to learn this one basic thing: the negative things in life will scream at you, demanding attention, but the positive things only whisper. You need to seek them out yourself and excellence will soon follow on its own.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Study personal development with an open mindset.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rather than being discouraged and viewing yourself as an individual who\u2019s full of faults, understand that no one, and I repeat,&nbsp;<em>no one&nbsp;<\/em>is perfect.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perfectionism is simply an illusion that will destroy your peace of mind the more you run after it. Your journey is yours alone. So, instead of seeing other people\u2019s success as milestones, use their achievements to gain inspiration and continue moving forward on the road to betterment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Above all, keep in mind that much like achieving happiness, personal development is not about arriving at a station \u2013 it\u2019s the journey itself that counts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You won\u2019t magically wake up one day as the best version of yourself. The little steps you take towards improvement are all that matter at the end.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>End Note<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you look up the term \u2018studying personal development\u2019 on the internet, you will be presented with a long list of all the benefits it brings and why it is a crucial step for anyone who\u2019s willing to live a happier and more successful life.
