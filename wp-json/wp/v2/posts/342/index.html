Rowling. Despite being born into a low-income family, Winfrey is known by millions of people all over the world today as a \u2018billionaire philanthropist.\u2019 Rowling, at one point in her life, was living penny-to-penny, and now, she is one of the wealthiest people in the world.<\/p>\n<p>What did they have in common that made them so wildly successful?<\/p>\n<p>They didn\u2019t give up on their dreams!<\/p>\n<p>They believed that they could turn their lives around and have whatever their hearts desired. And that\u2019s precisely what they did!<\/p>\n<p>Self-confidence. That\u2019s where they started.<\/p>\n<p>And it all begins with developing a sense of self-admiration \u2013 i.e., believing that you have the power to change your life regardless of what your current circumstances might be forcing you to think otherwise.<\/p>\n<p>Whether you are on the road to self-improvement, trying to find the hidden key to success, or wondering if a lack of confidence affects your quality of life, this post is for you.<\/p>\n<p>In this guide to life freedom, we discuss the following aspects of self-admiration:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>What is self-admiration?<\/li>\n<li>What are the benefits of self-admiration?<\/li>\n<li>How to gain freedom in life through self-admiration?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Ready to turn your dreams into a reality and live the life you have always wanted?<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s begin by taking a more in-depth look at what self-admiration is and shattering some commonly held but false beliefs about this feeling of self-love.<\/p>\n<h2>What Is Self Admiration?<\/h2>\n<p>Well, in the simplest terms, self-admiration is just what you would generally understand by the individual words that it is comprised of \u2013admiring yourself.<\/p>\n<p>Self-admiration is the feeling of being pleased with yourself. It is thinking well of yourself and taking pride in who you are.<\/p>\n<p>However, the concept of self-admiration can be quite confusing at times. This is because the term \u2018self-admiration\u2019 tends to mislead people into viewing the idea under a negative light.<\/p>\n<h3>Self Admiration \u2013 What It Is NOT<\/h3>\n<p>Being fond of oneself is usually notorious for leading to disastrous results. This is because self-admiration is generally considered to be synonymous with conceitedness, self-centeredness, egocentrism, and arrogance.<\/p>\n<p>While a thesaurus might approve of this notion, keep in mind that, in reality, self-admiration is NOT the same as any of these ideas.<\/p>\n<p>Some scholars have written books about how self-admiration is a \u2018disease of the soul\u2019 as it is responsible for leading people into sin. They believe that self-admiration tricks you into a false sense of self-righteousness. It deludes you into thinking that you are perfect. So, you stop striving towards betterment and ultimately fall into a stagnant lifestyle.<\/p>\n<p>It would be incorrect to say that they are entirely wrong in their stance \u2013 because if practiced at extremely high levels, self-admiration can indeed lead to such results.<\/p>\n<p>However, self-admiration, in essence, is not a bad thing. Basically, there is a very thin line that distinguishes self-admiration from other harmful behaviors like self-obsession, self-absorption, self-centeredness, and selfishness itself.<\/p>\n<p>It is essential to understand this if you want to be more successful in life.<\/p>\n<h3>So, What Does Admiring Yourself Really Mean?<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img class=\"wp-image-354\" src=\"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20200804023617im_\/https:\/\/347077-1073788-1-raikfcquaxqncofqfm.stackpathdns.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/what-does-self-admiration-means-1024x682.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20200804023617im_\/https:\/\/347077-1073788-1-raikfcquaxqncofqfm.stackpathdns.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/what-does-self-admiration-means-1024x682.jpg 1024w, \/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20200804023617im_\/https:\/\/347077-1073788-1-raikfcquaxqncofqfm.stackpathdns.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/what-does-self-admiration-means-300x200.jpg 300w, \/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20200804023617im_\/https:\/\/347077-1073788-1-raikfcquaxqncofqfm.stackpathdns.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/what-does-self-admiration-means-768x512.jpg 768w, \/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20200804023617im_\/https:\/\/347077-1073788-1-raikfcquaxqncofqfm.stackpathdns.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/what-does-self-admiration-means-1080x720.jpg 1080w, \/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20200804023617im_\/https:\/\/347077-1073788-1-raikfcquaxqncofqfm.stackpathdns.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/what-does-self-admiration-means.jpg 1280w\" alt=\"\" \/><\/figure>\n<p>Self-admiration is linked with building self-esteem. It is about celebrating your individuality, or in simple words, feeling\u00a0<em>confident<\/em>\u00a0in your own skin.<\/p>\n<p>It is the belief that you are not just worthy of receiving good things in life, but more so, that you are perfectly capable of achieving them on your own \u2013 if you want.<\/p>\n<p>Self-admiration is what empowers you to attain excellence. It motivates you to strive towards your goals in a way that you are bound to be successful in your endeavors.<\/p>\n<p>Admiring yourself has nothing to do with good looks. Rather, it entails embracing yourself wholeheartedly \u2013 imperfections and all.<\/p>\n<p>Self-admiration means that you appreciate your uniqueness and what makes you, you.<\/p>\n<h2>Why Self-Admiration Is the Hidden Key to Success \u2013 The Benefits of Being Your Own Admirer<\/h2>\n<p>Everyone feels proud of themselves whenever they are successful in attaining what they had set out to achieve. Self-admiration means that you take pride in the so-called \u2018failures\u2019 as well.<\/p>\n<p>When you stop being too hard on yourself and realize that mistakes ultimately help you improve, you are able to push past your fear of failure and work towards your goals, feeling more confident in your skills.

Or did you get the idea but are confused about implementing it in the right manner to get the desired results?<\/p>\n<p>Whatever the case might be, carefully read through the following steps to develop a deeper insight into how appreciating and believing in yourself can take you to greater heights.<\/p>\n<h3>Be True to Yourself<\/h3>\n<p>An important step in learning to be comfortable in your own skin is to stop pretending and doing things for the sake of making others happy.<\/p>\n<p>More often than not, living a happier, more purposeful life is not that difficult, but we tend to complicate things for ourselves. Trying to please others might help you win the love of your life or appear \u2018good\u2019 in the eyes of others temporarily. However, the relationships you form on that basis are bound to be hollow, and so, will fail to withstand the test of time.<\/p>\n<p>Being more successful is all about growing and evolving into the person you are capable of being. And you cannot reach there by trying to be like someone else.<\/p>\n<p>As Oscar Wilde famously said, \u2018Be yourself, because everyone else is already taken.\u2019<\/p>\n<p>Plus, an original is always worth more than a copy.<\/p>\n<p>When you start appreciating your own worth, the world naturally follows suit.<\/p>\n<h3>Let It Go<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img class=\"wp-image-355\" src=\"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20200804023617im_\/https:\/\/347077-1073788-1-raikfcquaxqncofqfm.stackpathdns.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/let-it-go-1024x614.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20200804023617im_\/https:\/\/347077-1073788-1-raikfcquaxqncofqfm.stackpathdns.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/let-it-go-1024x614.jpg 1024w, \/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20200804023617im_\/https:\/\/347077-1073788-1-raikfcquaxqncofqfm.stackpathdns.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/let-it-go-300x180.jpg 300w, \/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20200804023617im_\/https:\/\/347077-1073788-1-raikfcquaxqncofqfm.stackpathdns.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/let-it-go-768x460.jpg 768w, \/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20200804023617im_\/https:\/\/347077-1073788-1-raikfcquaxqncofqfm.stackpathdns.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/let-it-go-1080x647.jpg 1080w, \/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20200804023617im_\/https:\/\/347077-1073788-1-raikfcquaxqncofqfm.stackpathdns.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/let-it-go-627x376.jpg 627w, \/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20200804023617im_\/https:\/\/347077-1073788-1-raikfcquaxqncofqfm.stackpathdns.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/let-it-go-440x264.jpg 440w, \/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20200804023617im_\/https:\/\/347077-1073788-1-raikfcquaxqncofqfm.stackpathdns.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/let-it-go.jpg 1280w\" alt=\"\" \/><\/figure>\n<p>One of the best ways to leverage the power of self-admiration for being more successful in life is to identify and deal with the root causes of low self-esteem.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps you have always been the target of criticism from your family members. Maybe your parents\u2019 style of upbringing led you into believing that you aren\u2019t \u2018good enough.\u2019 Or perhaps you used to be a confident person until you stepped into the corporate world and had to deal with a lot of complaints from your manager or your clients.<\/p>\n<p>No matter what the main reason might be, you need to raise your self-esteem back up again.<\/p>\n<p>Remind yourself that what others think of you is none of your business. No one can make you feel inferior without your consent. Harsh remarks and rude comments cannot cause you any harm until you give them the power to.<\/p>\n<p>And if it\u2019s about your job performance, or if it\u2019s truly constructive criticism, take the feedback with an open mind. Try to see things from the other person\u2019s perspective. This helps make critical work for you.<\/p>\n<h3>Get Things Done<\/h3>\n<p>Maybe you want to start your own business, buy a big house, or establish a school for the underprivileged children, and so on. If your own goal seems to be too far from reality, there\u2019s no need to be disheartened. Rather than feeling overwhelmed by the big picture, focus on taking small steps instead.<\/p>\n<p>While others can surely support you in your mission, it is important to realize that the power to accomplish that goal lies with you only.<\/p>\n<p>Break down bigger tasks into smaller, actionable steps. When you are able to complete the initial steps successfully, you will feel more confident in your abilities. It then provides a strong point for growing your self-belief even further.<\/p>\n<h2>Disclaimer: Self Admiration is Healthy, Narcissism Is Not<\/h2>\n<p>When you hear the word \u2018self-admiration,\u2019 do you picture a person looking at themselves in a mirror admiringly?<\/p>\n<p>If you answered yes, you are not alone. And you are also not right.<\/p>\n<p>This type of self-love is tilted more towards what is commonly known as narcissism.<\/p>\n<p>Becoming your own admirer doesn\u2019t mean that you spend hours gazing at your reflection each day. Nor does it mean that looking at your own image should be a source of utmost delight.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, acknowledging that you are no less than an awesome person is part of the idea, but that surely isn\u2019t what self-admiration is all about.<\/p>\n<p>Self-admiration focuses on utilizing your inner strengths rather than your physical goodness to unlock the door to new opportunities. Narcissism, on the other hand, means that you are more concerned with the way you look rather than how well you perform. In a way, it makes you more dependent on others because you become reliant on external validation to work harder.<\/p>\n<p>However, self-admiration lets you internalize a sense of worthiness. So, whether or not you get the praise you deserve, you always feel good about yourself anyway.<\/p>\n<p>Put simply, self-admiration is healthy; narcissism is not. Period!<\/p>\n<h2>End Note<\/h2>\n<p>In the words of Prem Pal Rawat, \u2018When there can be that admiration for the self, the rest is very, very simple.\u2019<\/p>\n<p>Rawat is an Indian American who earned the Global Peace Ambassador award for his works promoting human welfare through self-knowledge and self-improvement.<\/p>\n<p>This alone is a solid proof that self-admiration is indeed the hidden key to success.<\/p>\n<p>Self-admiration helps you realize your inner talents, making you feel more confident in pursuing your goals in a way that yields the desired results.<\/p>\n<p>Just keep in mind that self-obsession and self-admiration are not the different sides of the same coin \u2013 the two are completely poles apart. The former will deter you from the road to success by making you arrogant and conceited, whereas the latter will allow you to effectively work towards bringing a change for good. So, start being your own cheerleader and witness how it empowers you to bring your A-game!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What is self-admiration?
